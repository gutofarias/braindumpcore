#+title: Markov Localization

* Markov Localization
A direct extension of the [[id:155935aa-af99-4629-b232-dfa0b48ad239][Bayes Filter]], but using the map $m$ of the
environment:

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Markov Localization}
  \label{markov_localization}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{Markov Localization}{$\text{bel}(x_{t-1}), u_t, z_t, m$}
    \ForAll{$x_t$}
    \State $\overline{\text{bel}}(t) = \int p(x_t | u_t, x_{t-1}, m)
    \text{bel}(x_{t-1}) dx$
    \State $\text{bel}(t) = \eta p(z_t | x_t, m)\overline{\text{bel}}(t) (x_t)$
    \EndFor
    \State \Return $bel(x_t)$
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The initial belief reflects initial knowledge of the robot pose, and
can be instantiated differently:

If the initial pose is known, $\mathrm{bel}(x_0)$ is a point-mass
distribution such that:

\begin{equation}
  \operatorname{bel}\left(x_{0}\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{1} & {\text { if } x_{0}=\bar{x}_{0}} \\ {0} & {\text { otherwise }}\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

However, point-mass distributions are discrete and do not have a
density, so in most scenarios, a narrow Gaussian centered around
$\overline{x}_0$ is used instead.

If the initial pose is unknown, $\mathrm{bel}(x_0)$ is initialized
with a uniform distribution over the space of all legal poses in the map.
