Is a method for [[file:task_space.org][task space]] control.

It consists in compute the torques and forces using the second order (acceleration) kinematics of the system. In order to do that one has to plan a trajectory to have the desired kinematics of the [[file:end_link.org][end-effector]]. Then, compute the joints acceleration (using the end-effector kinematics) and then compute the torques and forces necessary to create such accelerations.

The controller is presented in:
