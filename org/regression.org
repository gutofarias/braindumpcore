* Introduction

Regression analysis is a conceptually simple method for investigating
functional relationships between variables. The relationship is
expressed in the form of an equation or a model connecting the
response or dependent variable and one or more explanatory or
predictor variables.

We denote the response variable by $Y$, and the set of predictor
variables by $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$, where $p$ denotes the number of
predictor variables.

The general regression model is specified as:

\begin{equation} \label{dfn:general_regression}
  Y = f(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p) + \epsilon
\end{equation}

An example is the linear regression model:

\begin{equation}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \dots + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon
\end{equation}

where $\beta_0, \dots, \beta_p$ called the regression paramaters or
coefficients, are unknown constants to be estimated from the data.
$\epsilon$ is the random error representing the discrepancy in the
approximation.

** Steps in Regression Analysis

*1. Statement of the problem*

Formulation of the problem includes determining the questions to be
addressed.

*2. Selection of Potentially Relevant Variables*

We select a set of variables that are thought by the experts in the
area of study to explain or predict the response variable.

Each of these variables could be /qualitative/ or /quantitative/. A
technique used in casse where the response variable is binary is
called /logistic regression/. If all predictor variables are
qualitative, the techniques used in the analysis of the data are
called the analysis of variance techniques. If some of the predictor
variables are quantitative while others are qualitative, regression
analysis in these cases is called the /analysis of covariance/.

| Non-linear             | The relationship between the response and some of the predictors is non-linear (no transformation to make parameters appear linearly) |

*3. Model specification*

The form of the model that is thought to relate the response variable to
the set of predictor variables can be specified initially by experts
in the area of study based on their knowledge or their objective
and/or subjective judgments.

We need to select the form of the function $f(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p)$
in label:dfn:general_regression.


*4. Method of Fitting*

We want to perform parameter estimation or model fitting after
defining the model and collecting the data. the most commonly used
method of estimation is called the /least squares/ method. Other
estimation methods we consider are the maximum likelihood method,
ridge regression and the principal components method.

*5. Model Fitting*

The estimates of the regression parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots,
\beta_p$ are denoted by $\hat{\beta_0}, \hat{\beta_1}, \dots,
\hat{\beta_p}$. the obtained $\hat{Y}$ denotes the predicted value.

*6. Model Criticism and Selection*

The validity of statistical methods depend on certain assumptions, about
the data and the model. We need to address the following questions:

1. What are the required assumptions?
2. For each of these assumptions, how do we determine if they are valid?
3. What can be done in cases where assumptions do not hold?

* Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is a straightforward approach for predicting
a quantitative response $Y$ on the basis of a single predictor
variable $X$. Mathematically, we write this linear relationship as:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:slr}
  Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
\end{equation}

We describe this as regressing $Y$ on $X$.

We wish to measure both the direction and strength of the relationship
between $Y$ and $X$. Two related measures, known as the /covariance/ and
the /correlation coefficient/ are developed later.

We use our training data to produce estimates $\hat{\beta_0}$ and
$\hat{\beta_1}$ for the model coefficients, and we can predict outputs
by computing:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{y} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} X
\end{equation}

Let $\hat{y_i} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}$ be the prediction of
$Y$ based on the ith value of $X$. Then $e_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}$
represents the ith /residual/. We can define the residual sum of squares
(RSS) as:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dfn:rss}
  \mathrm{RSS} = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \dots + e_n^2
\end{equation}

The least squares approach chooses $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$
to minimise the RSS.

If $f$ is to be approximated by a linear function, then we can write
the relationship as:

\begin{equation}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon$ is an error term -- the catch-all for what we miss
with this simple model. For example, the true relationship is probably
not linear, and other variables cause variation in $Y$. It is
typically assumed that the error term is independent of $X$.

We need to assess the accuracy of our estimates. How far off will a
single estimation of $\hat{\mu}$ be? In general, we can answer this
question by computing the standard error of $\hat{\mu}$, written as
$\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\mu})$. This is given by:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dfn:se}
  \mathrm{Var}(\hat{\mu}) = \mathrm{SE}(\hat{\mu})^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of each of the realizations
$y_i$ of $Y$.

Standard errors can be used to compute /confidence intervals/. A 95%
confidence interval is defined as a range of values such that with 95%
probability, the range will contain the true unknown value of the
parameter. For linear regression, the 95% confidence interval for
$\beta_1$ approximately takes the form:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{\beta_1} \pm 2 \cdot SE(\hat{\beta_1})
\end{equation}

Standard errors can also be used to perform hypothesis tests on the
coefficients. The most common hypothesis test involves testing the
null hypothesis of:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dfn:null_hyp}
  H_0 : \mathrm{There is no relationship between X and Y} (\beta_1 = 0)
\end{equation}

versus the alternative hypothesis:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dfn:alt_hyp}
  H_a : \mathrm{There is a relationship between X and Y} (\beta_1 \ne 0)
\end{equation}

To test the null hypothesis, we need to determine whether
$\hat{\beta_1}$ is sufficiently far from zero that we can be
confident that $\beta_1$ is non-zero. How far is far enough? This
depends on the accuracy of $\hat{\beta_1}$, or
$\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\beta_1})$. In practice, we compute a /t-statistic/,
given by:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dfn:t-statistic}
  t = \frac{\hat{\beta_1} - 0}{\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\beta_1})}
\end{equation}

which measures the number of standard deviations that $\hat{\beta_1}$
is away from 0. If there really is no relationship between $X$ and
$Y$, then we expect that Eq. label:eqn:dfn:t-statistic will have a
t-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom. The t-distribution has a
bell shape and for values of $n$ greater than approximately 30 it is
similar to the normal distribution.

It is a simple matter to compute the probability of observing any
number equal to $\lVert t \rVert$ or larger in absolute value,
assuming $\beta_1 = 0$. We call this probability the /p-value/. A small
p-value indicates that it is unlikely to observe such a substantial
association between the predictor and the response due to chance.

** Assessing the accuracy of the model

Once we have rejected the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative
hypothesis, it is natural to want to quantify the extent to which the
model fits the data.

*** Residual Standard Error (RSE)

After we compute the least square estimates of the parameters of a
linear model, we can compute the following quantities:

\begin{align}
\mathrm{SST} &= \sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2 \\
\mathrm{SSR} &= \sum(\hat{y_i} - \bar{y})^2 \\
\mathrm{SSE} &= \sum(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
\end{align}

A fundamental equality in both simple and multiple regressions is
given by $\mathrm{SST} = \mathrm{SSR} + \mathrm{SSE}$. This can be
interpreted as: The deviation from the mean is equal to the deviation
due to fit, plus the residual.

*** $R^2$ statistic

The RSE provides an absolute measure of lack of fit of the model to
the data. But since it is measured in the units of $Y$, it is not
always clear what constitutes a good RSE. The $R^2$ statistic provides
an alternative measure of fit. It takes a form of a proportion, and
takes values between 0 and 1, independent of the scale of $Y$.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dfn:r_squared}
  R^2 = \frac{\mathrm{SSR}}{\mathrm{SST}} = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{SSE}}{\mathrm{SST}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{SST} = \sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2$ is the /total sum of
squares/. SST measures the total variance in the response $Y$, and can
be thought of as the amount of variability inherent in the response
before the regression is performed. Hence, $R^2$ measures the
proportion of variability in $Y$ that can be explained using $X$.

Note that the correlation coefficient $r = \mathrm{Cor}(X, Y)$ is
related to the $R^2$ in the simple linear regression setting: $r^2 =
R^2$.

* Multiple Linear Regression

We can extend the simple linear regression model to accommodate
multiple predictors:

\begin{equation}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon
\end{equation}

We choose $\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p$ to minimise the sum of
squared residuals:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
\end{equation}

Unlike the simple regression estimates, the multiple regression
coefficient estimates have complicated forms that are most easily
represented using matrix algebra.

** Interpreting Regression Coefficients

$\beta_0$, the constant coefficient, is the value of $Y$ when $X_1 =
X_2 \dots = X_p = 0$, as in simple regression. The regression
coefficient $\beta_j$ has several interpretations.

First, it may be interpreted as the change in $Y$ corresponding to a
unit change in $X_j$ when all other predictor variables are held
constant. In practice, predictor variables may be inherently related,
and it is impossible to hold some of them constant while varying
others. The regression coefficient $\beta_j$ is also called the
partial regression coefficient, because $\beta_j$ represents the
contribution of $X_j$ to the response variable $Y$ adjusted for other
predictor variables.

** Centering and Scaling

The magnitudes of the regression coefficients in a regression equation
depend on the unit of measurements of the variables. To make the
regression coefficients unit-less, one may first center or scale the
variables before performing regression computations.

When dealing with constant term models, it is convenient to center and
scale the variables, but when dealing with no-intercept models, we
need only to scale the variables.

A centered variable is obtained by subtracting from each observation
the mean of all observations. For example, the centered response
variable is $(Y - \bar{y})$, and the centered jth predictor variable
is $(X_j - \bar{x}_j)$. The mean of a centered variable is 0.

The centered variables can also be scaled. Two types of scaling are
usually performed: unit-length scaling and standardizing.

Unit-length scaling of response variable $Y$ and the jth predictor
variable $X_j$ is obtained as follows:

\begin{align}
  \tilde{Z}_y &= (Y - \bar{y})/L_y \\
  \tilde{Z}_j &= (X - \bar{x}_j)/L_j \\
\end{align}
where:

\begin{equation}
  L_y = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2} \text{ and } L_j =
  \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{ij} - \bar{x}_j)^2}\text{ , } j = 1,2,\dots,p
\end{equation}

The quantities $L_y$ is referred to as the length of the centered
variable $Y_\bar{y}$ because it measures the size or the magnitudes of
the observations in $Y - \bar{y}$. $L_j$ has a similar interpretation.

Unit length scaling has the following property:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Cor}(X_j, X_k) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}z_{ij}z_{ik}
\end{equation}

The second type of scaling is called standardizing, which is defined
by:

\begin{align}
  \tilde{Y} &= \frac{Y - \bar{y}}{s_y} \\
  \tilde{X}_j &= \frac{X_j - \bar{x}_j}{s_j} \text{ , } j = 1, \dots, p
\end{align}

where $s_y$ and $s_j$ are the standard deviations of the response and
jth predictor variable respectively. The standardized variables have
mean zero and unit standard deviations. 

Since correlations are unaffected by centering or scaling, it is
sufficient and convenient to deal with either unit-length scaled or
standardized models.

** Properties of Least-square Estimators

Under certain regression assumptions, the least-square estimators have
the following properties:

1. The estimator $\hat{\beta}_j$ is an unbiased estimate of
   $\hat{\beta_j}$ and has a variance of $\sigma^2 c_{jj}$, where
   $c_{jj}$ is the jth diagonal element of the inverse of a matrix
   known as the corrected sums of squares and products matrix. The
   covariance between $\hat{\beta}_i$ and $\hat{\beta}_j$ is $\sigma^2
   c_{ij}$. For all unbiased estimates that are linear in the
   observations the least squares estimators have the smallest
   variance.

2. The estimator $\hat{\beta}_j$, is normally distributed with mean
   $\beta_j$ and variance $\sigma^2 c_{jj}$.

3. $W = SSE/\sigma^2$ has a $\chi^2$ distribution with $n - p -1$
   degrees of freedom, and $\hat{\beta}_j$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ are
   distributed independently from each other.

4. The vector $\hat{\beta} = (\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta_1}, \dots,
   \hat{\beta_p})$ has a $(p+1)$-dimensional normal distribution with
   mean vector $\beta = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p)$ and
   variance-covariance matrix with elements $\sigma^2  c_{ij}$.

** Important Questions in Multiple Regression Models
We can answer some important questions using the multiple regression
model:

*1. Is there a relationship between the response and the predictors?*

The strength of the linear relationship between $Y$ and the set of
predictors $X_1, X_2, \dots X_p$ can be assessed through the
examination of the scatter plot of $Y$ versus $\hat{Y}$, and the
correlation coefficient $\mathrm{Cor}(Y, \hat{Y})$. The coefficient of
determination $R^2 = [\mathrm{Cor}(Y, \hat{Y})]^2$ may be interpreted
as the proportion of total variability in the response variables $Y$
that can be accounted for by the set of predictor variables $X_1, X_2,
\dots, X_p$. 

A quantity related to $R^2$ knows as the adjusted R-squared, $R_a^2$,
is also used for judging the goodness of fit. It is defined as:

\begin{align}
  R_a^2 &= 1 - \frac{SSE/(n-p-1)}{SST/(n-1)} \\
        &= 1 - \frac{n-1}{n-p-1}(1-R^2)
\end{align}

$R_a^2$ is sometimes used to compared models having different numbers
of predictor variables.

If we do a hypothesis test on $H_1 : \beta_j \ne \beta_j^0$, we can do
a t-test:

\begin{equation}
  t_j = \frac{\hat{\beta_j} - \beta_j^0}{s.e.(\hat{\beta}_j)}
\end{equation}

which has a Stundent's t-distribution with $n-p-1$ degrees of freedom.
The test is carried out by comparing the observed value with the
appropriate critical value $t_{(n-p-1), \alpha/2}$.

If we are comparing $H_0$ label:eqn:dfn:null_hyp and $H_a$
label:eqn:dfn:alt_hyp, and we do so by computing the /F-statistic/:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dfn:f-statistic}
  F = \frac{(\mathrm{TSS} - \mathrm{RSS})/p}{\mathrm{RSS}/(n-p-1)}
\end{equation}

If the linear model is correct, one can show that:

\begin{equation}
E \{RSS/(n-p-1)\} = \sigma^2
\end{equation}

and that provided $H_0$ is true,

\begin{equation}
E \{(\mathrm{TSS}-\mathrm{RSS})/p\} = \sigma^2
\end{equation}

Hence, when there is no relationship between the response and the
predictors, one would expect the F-statistic to be close to 1. if
$H_a$ is true, then we expect $F$ to be greater than 1.

*2. Deciding on important variables*

It is possible that all of the predictors are associated with the
response, but it is more often the case that the response is only
related to a subset of the predictors. The task of determining which
predictors are associated is referred to as /variable selection/.
Various statistics can be used to judge the quality of a model. These
include Mallow's $C_p$, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian
information criterion (BIC), and adjusted $R^2$.

There are $2^p$ models that contains a subset of $p$ variables. Unless
$p$ is small, we cannot consider all $2^p$ models, and we need an
efficient approach to choosing a smaller set of models to consider.
There are 3 classical approaches for this task:

1. /Forward selection/: We begin with the null model -- a model that
   contains an intercept but no predictors. We then fit p simple
   linear regressions and add to the null model the variable that
   results in the lowest RSS. We then add to that model the variable
   that results in the lowest RSS for the new two-variable model, and
   repeat.
2. /Backward selection/: We start with all variables in the model, andd
   remove the variable with the largest p-value -- that is the
   variable that is the least statistically significant. The new
   (p-1)-variable model is fit, and the variable with the largest
   p-value is removed, and repeat.
3. Mixed selection. This is a combination of forward and
   backward-selection. We once again start with the null model. The
   p-values of the variables can become larger as new variables are
   added to the model. Once the p-value of one of the variables in the
   model rises above a certain threshold, they are removed.

*3. Model Fit*

Two of the most common numerical measures of model fit are the RSE
and $R^2$, the fraction of variance explained.

It turns out that $R^2$ will always increase when more variables are
added to the model, even if those variables are only weakly associated
with the response. This is because adding another variable to the
least squares equations must allow us to fit the training data more
accurately. Models with more variables can have higher RSE if the
decrease in RSS is small relative to the increase in $p$.

*4. Predictions*

Once we have fit the multiple regression model, it is straightforward
to predict the response $Y$ on the basis of a set of values for
predictors $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$. However, there are 3 sorts of
uncertainty associated with this prediction:

1. The coefficient estimates $\hat{\beta_0}, \hat{\beta_1}, \dots,
   \hat{\beta_p}$ are estimates for $\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots,
   \beta_p$.

That is, the least squares plane:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{Y} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}X_1 + \dots + \hat{\beta_p}X_p
\end{equation}

 is only an estimate for the true
population regression plane:

\begin{equation}
  f(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p
\end{equation}

 This inaccuracy is related to the reducible error. We can compute a
confidence interval in order to determine how close $\hat{Y}$ will be
to $f(X)$.

2. In practice, assuming a linear model for $f(X)$ is almost always an
   approximation of reality, so there is an additional source of
   potentially reducible error which we call /model bias/.

3. Even if we knew $f(X)$, the response value cannot be predicted
   perfectly because of the random error $\epsilon$ is the model. How
   mich will $Y$ vary from $\hat{Y}$? We use prediction intervals to
   answer the question. Prediction intervals are always wider than
   confidence intervals, because they incorporate both the error in
   the estimate for $f(X)$, and the irreducible error.

** Qualitative Variables

Thus far our discussion had been limited to quantitative variables.
How can we incorporate qualitative variables such as gender into our
regression model?

For variables that take on only two values, we can create a dummy
variable of the form (for example in gender):

\begin{equation}
  x_i = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if ith person is female} \\
    0 & \text{if ith person is male}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

and use this variable as a predictor in the equation. We can also use
the {-1, 1} encoding. For qualitative variables that take on more than
2 values, a single dummy variable cannot represent all values. We can
add additional variables, essentially performing a one-hot encoding.

** Extending the Linear Model

The standard linear regression model provides interpretable results
and works quite well on many real-world problems. However, it makes
highly restrictive assumptions that are often violated in practice.

The two most important assumptions of the linear regression model are
that the relationship between the response and the predictors are:

1. /additive/: the effect of changes in a predictor $X_j$ on the
   response $Y$ are independent of the values of the other predictors.
2. /linear/: the change in the response $Y$ due to a one-unit change in
   $X_j$ is constant, regardless of the value of $X_j$

How can we remove the additive assumption? We can add an interaction
term for two variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\hat{Y_2} = \hat{Y_1} + \beta_{p+1} X_i X_j
\end{equation}

We can analyze the importance of the interaction term by looking at
its p-value. The hierarchical principle states that if we include an
interaction in a model, we should also include the main effects, even
if the p-values associated with their coefficients are not
significant. 

How can we remove the assumption of linearity? A simple way is to use
polynomial regression.

** Potential Problems
When we fit a linear regression model to a particular data set, many
problems may occur. Most common among these are the following:

1. Non-linearity of the response-predictor relationships
2. Correlation of error terms
3. Non-constant variance of error terms
4. Outliers
5. High-leverage points
6. Collinearity

*** Non-linearity of the Data
The assumption of a linear relationship between response and
predictors aren't always true. /Residual plots/ are a useful graphical
tool for identifying non-linearity. This is obtained by plotting the
residuals $e_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}$ versus the predictor $x_i$. Ideally
the residual plot will show no discernible pattern. The presence of a
pattern may indicate a problem with some aspect of the linear model.

If the residual plots show that there are non-linear associations in
the data, then a simple approach is to use non-linear transformations
of the predictors, such as $\log X$, $\sqrt{X}$ and $X^2$.

*** Correlation of Error Terms

An important assumption of the linear regression model is that the
error terms, $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \dots, \epsilon_p$ are
uncorrelated.  The standard errors for the estimated regression
coefficients are computed based on this assumption. This is mostly
mitigated by proper experiment design.

*** Non-constant Variance of Error Terms
Variances of the error terms may increase with the value of the
response. One can identify non-constant variances in the errors, or
heteroscedasticity, from the presence of a funnel shape in the
residual plot.

[[file:images/statistical_learning/screenshot_2019-01-08_15-14-34.png]]

*** Outliers
An outlier is a point from which $y_i$ is far from the value predicted
by the model.  It is atypical for an outlier that does not have an
unusual predictor value to have little effect on the least squares
fit. However, it can cause other problems, such as dramatically
altering the computed values of RSE, $R^2$ and p-values.

Residual plots can clearly identify outliers. One solution is to
simply remove the observation, but care must be taken to first
identify whether the outlier is indicative of a deficiency with the
model, such as a missing predictor.

*** High Leverage Points
Observations with high leverage have an unusual value for $x_i$.
High leverage observations typically have a substantial impact on the
regression line. These are easy to identify, by looking for values
outside the normal range of the observations. We can also compute the
leverage statistic. for a simple linear regression:

\begin{equation}
  h_i = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_i - \bar{x_i})^2}{\sum_{i' =
      1}^n(x_{i'} - \bar{x})^2}
\end{equation}

*** Collinearity
Collinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor
variables are closely related to one another. The presence of
collinearity can pose problems in the regression context: it can be
difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear
variables on the response. A contour plot of the RSS associated with
different possible coefficient estimates can show collinearity.

Another way to detect collinearity is to look at the correlation
matrix of the predictors. An element of this matrix that is large in
absolute value indicates a pair of highly correlated variables, and
therefore a collinearity problem in the data.

Not all collinearity problems can be detected by inspection of the
correlation matrix: it is possible for collinearity to exist between
three or more variables even if no pairs of variables has a
particularly high correlation. This situation is called
/multicollinearity/. We instead compute the /variance inflation factor/
(VIF). The VIF is the ratio of the variance of $\hat{\beta_j}$ when
fitting the full model divided by the variance of $\hat{\beta_j}$ if
fit on its own. The smallest possible value for VIF is 1, indicating a
complete absence of collinearity. As a rule of thumb, a VIF exceeding
values of 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dfn:vif}
  \mathrm{VIF}(\hat{\beta_j}) = \frac{1}{1-R^2_{X_j|X_{-j}}}
\end{equation}

where $R^2_{X_j|X_{-j}}$ is the regression of $X_j$ onto all of the
other predictors.


The data consists of $n$ observations on a dependent or response
variable $Y$, and $p$ predictor or explanatory variables. The
relationship between $Y$ and $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$ is represented by:

* Linear Basis Function Models
  We can extend the class of models by considering linear combinations of fixed non-linear functions of the input variables, of the form:

\begin{equation}
  y(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M-1} w_j
  \phi_j(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{\phi}(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}

There are many choices on non-linear basis functions, such as the
Gaussian basis function:

\begin{equation}
  \phi_j(x) = \mathrm{exp}\left\{ - \frac{(x - \mu_j)^2}{2s^2} \right\}
\end{equation}

or the sigmoidal basis function:

\begin{equation}
\phi_j(x) = \sigma\left( \frac{x - \mu_j}{s} \right)
\end{equation}

* Regression Diagnostics

In fitting a model to a given body of data, we would like to ensure
that the fit is not overly determined by one or a few observations.
The distribution theory, confidence intervals, and tests of hypotheses
are valid and have meaning only if the standard regression assumptions
are satisfied. 

** The Standard Regression Assumptions

*Assumptions about the form of the model*: The model that relates the
   response $Y$ to the predictors $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$ is assumed to
   be linear in the regression parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots,
   \beta_p$ respectively:

\begin{equation}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \dots + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon
\end{equation}

which implies that the ith observation can be written as:

\begin{equation}
  y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \dots \beta_px_{ip} + \epsilon_i,
  i = 1,2,\dots,n
\end{equation}

Checking the linearity assumption can be done by examining the scatter
plot of $Y$ versus $X$, but linearity in multiple regression is more
difficult due to the high dimensionality of the data. In some cases,
data transformations can lead to linearity.

*Assumptions about the errors*: The errors $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2,
  \dots, \epsilon_n$ are assumed to be independently and identically
  distributed normal random variables each with mean zero and a
  common variance $\sigma^2$. Four assumptions are made here:
   
   - The error $\epsilon_i$ has a normal distribution. This normality
     assumption can be validated by examining appropriate graphs of
     the residuals.

   - The errors $\epsilon_i$ have mean 0.

   - The errors $\epsilon_i$ have the same (but unknown) variance
     $\sigma^2$. This is the constant variance assumption, also known
     as the homogeneity or homoscedasticity assumption. When this
     assumption does not hold, the problem is called the heterogeneity
     or the heteroscedasticity problem.

   - The errors $\epsilon_i$ are independent of each other. When this
     assumption doesn't hold, we have the auto-correlation problem.

*Assumption about the predictors*: Three assumptions are made here:

   - The predictor variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$ are nonrandom. This
     assumption is satisfied only when the experimenter can set the
     values of the predictor variables at predetermined levels. When
     the predictor variables are random variables, all inferences are
     conditional, conditioned on the observed data.

   - The values $x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \dots, x_{nj}$ are measured without
     error. This assumption is hardly ever satisfied, and errors in
     measurement will affect the residual variance, the multiple
     correlation coefficient, and the individual estimates of the
     regression coefficients. Correction for measurement errors of the
     estimated regression coefficients, even in the simplest case
     where all measurement errors are uncorrelated, requires a
     knowledge of the ratio between the variances and the random
     error. These quantities are seldom known.

   - The predictor variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p$ are assumed to be
     linearly independent of each other. This assumption is required
     to guarantee the uniqueness of the least squares solution. If
     this assumption is violated, the problem is referred to as the
     collinearity problem.

*Assumption about the observations*: All observations are equally
reliable and have an approximately equal role in determining the
regression results.

A feature of the method of least squares is that minor violations of
the underlying assumptions do not invalidate the inferences or
conclusions drawn from the analysis in a major way. However, gross
violations can severely distort conclusions.

** Types of Residuals

A simple method for detecting model deficiencies in regression
analysis is the examination of residual plots. Residual plots will
point to serious violations in one or more of the standard assumptions
when they exist. The analysis of residuals may lead to suggestions of
structure or point to information in the data that might be missed or
overlooked if the analysis is based only on summary statistics.

When fitting the linear model to a set of data by least squares, we
obtain the fitted values:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}1 x_{i1} +\dots +
  \hat{\beta}_p x_{ip}
\end{equation}

and the corresponding ordinary least squares residuals:

\begin{equation}
e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
\end{equation}

The fitted values can also be written in an alternative form as:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y_i} = p_{i1}y_1 + p_{i2}y_2 + \dots + p_{in}y_n
\end{equation}

where the $p_{ij}$ are quantities that depend only on the values of
the predictor variables. In simple regression $p_{ij}$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
  p_{ij} = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{\left( x_i + \overline{x} \right)
    \left( x_j - \overline{x} \right)}{\sum (x_i - \overline{x})^2}
\end{equation}

In multiple regression the $p_{ij}$ are elements of matrix known as
the hat or projection matrix.

The value $p_{ii}$ is called the leverage value for the ith
observation, because $\hat{y}_i$ is a weighted sum of all the
observations in $Y$ and $p_{ii}$ is the weight (leverage) given to
$y_i$ in determining the ith fitted value $\hat{y}_i$. Thus, we have
$n$ leverage values, and they are denoted by:

\begin{equation}
  p_{11}, p_{22}, \dots, p_{nn}
\end{equation}

When the standard assumptions hold, the ordinary residuals, $e_1, e_2,
\dots, e_n$ will sum to zero, but they will not have the same variance
because:

\begin{equation}
  \textrm{Var}(e_i) = \sigma^2\left( 1 - p_{ii} \right)
\end{equation}

To over come the problem of unequal variances, we standardize the ith
residual $e_i$ by dividing by its standard deviation:

\begin{equation}
  z_i = \frac{e_i}{\sigma \sqrt{1 - p_{ii}}}
\end{equation}

This is called the ith standardized residual because it has mean zero
and standard deviation 1. The standardized residuals depend on
$\sigma$, the unknown standard deviation of $\epsilon$. An unbiased of
$\sigma^2$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{\sum e_i^2}{n - p - 1} = \frac{\sum (y_i -
    \hat{y}_i)^2}{n - p - 1} = \frac{\textrm{SSE}}{n -p-1}
\end{equation}

An alternative unbiased estimate of $\sigma^2$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\sigma}_{(i)}^2 = \frac{SSE_{(i)}}{n - p -2}
\end{equation}

where $SSE_{(i)}$ is the sum of squared residuals when we fit the
model to the n - 1 observations by omitting the ith observation.

Using $\hat{\sigma}$ as an estamite of $\sigma$, we obtain:

\begin{equation}
  r_i = \frac{e_i}{\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{1 - p_{ii}}}
\end{equation}

which we term the internally studentized residual. Using teh other
unbiased estimate, we get:

\begin{equation}
  r_i^* = \frac{e_i}{\hat{\sigma_{(i)}}\sqrt{1 - p_{ii}}}
\end{equation}

which is a monotonic transformation of $r_i$. This is termed the
externally studentized residual. The standardized residuals do not sum
to zero, but they all have the same variance. 

The externally standardized residuals follow a t-distribution with n - p - 2 degrees 
of freedom, but the internally standardized residuals do not. However, with a 
moderately large sample, these residuals should approximately have a standard 
normal distribution. The residuals are not strictly independently distributed, but 
with a large number of observations, the lack of independence may be
ignored.

** Graphical methods

*** Before fitting the model

Graphs plotted before fitting the model serve as exploratory tools.
There are four categories of graphs:

*1. One-dimensional graphs*

One-dimensional graphs give a general idea of the distribution of each
individual variable. One of the following graphs may be used:

- histogram
- stem-and-leaf display
- dot-plot
- box-plot

These graphs indicate whether the variable is symmetric, or skewed.
When a variable is skewed, it should be transformed, generally
using a logarithmic transformation. Univariate graphs also point out
the presence of outliers in the variables. However, no observations
should be deleted at this stage. 

*2. Two-dimensional graphs*

We can take the variables in pairs and look at the scatter plots of
each variable versus each other variable in the data set. These
explore relationships between each pair of variables and identify
general patterns. These pairwise plots can be arranged in a matrix
format, known as the /draftsman's plot/ or the /plot matrix/. In simple
regression, we expect the plot of $Y$ versus $X$ to show a linear
pattern. However, scatter plots of $Y$ versus each predictor variable
may or may not show linear patterns.

Beyond these, there are rotation plots and dynamic graphs which serve
as powerful visualizations of the data in more than 2 dimensions.

*** Graphs after fitting a model

The graphs after fitting a model help check the assumptions and assess
the adequacy of the fit of a given model.

1. Graphs checking linearity and normality assumptions

When the number of variables is small, the assumption of linearity can
be checked by interactively and dynamically manipulating plots
discussed in the previous section. However, this quickly becomes
difficult with many predictor variables. Plotting the standardized
residuals can help check the linearity and normality assumptions.

- Normal probability plot of the standardized residuals: This is a
  plot of the ordered standardized residuals versus the normal scores.
  The normal scores are what we would expect to obtain if we take a
  sample of size $n$ from a standard normal distribution. If the
  residuals are normally distributed, the ordered residuals should be
  approximately the same as the ordered normal scores. Under the
  normality assumption, this plot should resemble a straight line with
  intercept zero and slope of 1.

- Scatter plots of the standardized residual against each of the
  predictor variables: Under the standard assumptions, the
  standardized residuals are uncorrelated with each of the predictor
  variables. If the assumptions hold, the plot should be a random
  scatter of points.

- Scatter plot of the standardized residual versus the fitted values:
  Under the standard assumptions, the standardized residuals are also
  uncorrelated with the fitted values. Hence, this plot should also be
  a random scatter of points.

- Index plot of the standardized residuals: we display the
  standardized residuals versus the observation number. If the order
  in which the observations were taken is immaterial, this plot is not
  needed. However, if the order is important, a plot of the residuals
  in serial order may be used to check the assumption of the
  independence of the errors.
