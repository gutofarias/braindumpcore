#+title: Gpipe

Gpipe is a scalable pipeline parallelism library published by Google
Brain, which allows for efficient training of large, memory-consuming
models cite:huang18_gpipe. Pipeline parallelism allows for
[[id:b85483b8-9e57-4b6d-babf-5013f99119a0][Fast Neural Network Training]].

In Gpipe, neural networks with sequential layers are partitioned
across accelerators. The pipeline parallelism divides each input
mini-batch into smaller micro-batches, enabling different accelerators
to work on different micro-batches simultaneously. This is especially
useful in [[id:1c9a7af1-fe4f-49b7-a19b-961bd125cdb8][Large Batch Training]].
