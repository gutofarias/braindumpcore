#+title: Reference Prior

The notion of reference prior is similar to that of a [[id:a967cbbd-0135-4a0f-b695-f493ce6edec8][non-informative
prior]], but there are subtle differences. The uniform prior is arguably
non-informative, but is it not a good reference, because it is not
always invariant under reparamaterization.

Consider a reparameterization $\gamma = \log \theta$, converting the
support of the parameter to the real line. The prior on $\gamma$ is
given by:

\begin{equation}
  p_\gamma (\gamma) = p(\theta)|J| = |J|
\end{equation}

where $|J| = \frac{d \theta}{d \gamma}$ from the [[id:8a78cb4c-8c24-48b1-9e9d-c5e743713733][Change of Variables Theorem]].

\begin{equation}
  p_\gamma (\gamma) = e^\gamma, - \infty < \gamma < + \infty
\end{equation}

which is clearly not uniform. A prior that is invariant to
transformation, and easy to compute, is the [[id:82c97e2a-e092-4c69-a67b-703bf4e3f221][Jeffreys Prior]].
