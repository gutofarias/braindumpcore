#+title: Uncertainty in Robotics

Robotic applications increasingly deal with more unstructured
environments. Robots that can perceive and deal with uncertainty are
much more robust in these scenarios.

Uncertainty arises from:

- Environment :: unpredictability of the physical world
- Sensors :: limitations in sensor perception
- Robots :: robot actuations involve motors that have control noise
- Models :: models of the world inherently inaccurate
- Computation :: many algorithms are approximate

#+begin_quote
A robot that carries a notion of its own uncertainty that acts
accordingly is superior to one that does not.

* Pros
1. Robust, and scale better to complex, unstructured environments
2. Weaker requirements on the accuracy of the models compared to
   classical planning algorithms
3. Sound methodology for many flavours of robot learning
4. Broadly applicable to many problems, including perception and
   action

* Cons
- Relatively computationally inefficient
- Requires approximation (exact posteriors are computationally intractable)
