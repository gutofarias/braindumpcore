The Student's t-distribution arises when estimating the mean of a
normally distributed population, when the sample size is small and the
population standard deviation is unknown.

The Student's t-test assess the statistical significance of the
difference between 2 sample means. It also arises in Bayesian analyses
of data from a normal family.
