I saw it in an article (cite:huang2017) and it was used for [[file:collision_avoidance.org][collision avoidance]] in a [[file:formation_control.org][formation control]]. The idea was to add a repulsive field over the spacecrafts. This repulsive field would generate a repulsive force when two spacecrafts were getting close. Then the repulsive force would be added to the control law.
