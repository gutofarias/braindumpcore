Indonesia's flood relief effort empowered by geolocated tweets.

Half of the world's millennials will be in Asia by 2020. Asia is a
great canvas for solving and innovating on problems, making Asia an
engine for growth for Twitter.

Transliteration and languages are the next frontier of opportunity.

*** Data Science Organization in Twitter

1. Foundational Data Science work
2. Growth Team
3. Habits Team
4. Health/Metrics Team

*** Product Data Science Lifecycle

Opportunity Sizing -> Testable Hypotheses -> Experiment & Design ->
Instrumentation & Metrics -> Experiment Review -> Post-release
Check-ins

- Experiment review includes analyzing user behaviour, to come up with
  new ideas

** Diana Macias, Client Engineering Manager

*** 140 character limit story

- 2016: Timing wasn't right for going beyond 140
- Email sent by a Japanese engineer (Iku) previously iOS engineer,
  now on machine learning team:
  - From personal research project, Japanese characters need 140 characters, but English users need
    280-300 characters
  - Japanese can contain about 1.9x more information than English in a
    character, visualized by separating tweets by language
  - Japanese plain tweet length averages around 14 characters
  - Tweet lengths fit a log-normal distribution: extending the
    log-normal distribution for english, 280 characters is the number found.
- The 280 character project was born, customizing character limit
  based on the keyboard.
- 9% of tweets hit the 140 limit, 1% of the tweets hit the 280 limit
- Post analysis of 280 project:
  - Less abbreviations
  - More kind words like "please", "thank you"
  - Same tweet length

** Angad Singh, Data Science Team Lead, Twitter SG

*** Twitter SG Data Science Team
- small team of 5 data scientists
- focused on user behaviour and international growth
- experimentation on Android/iOS/Web

*** 3Vs of data at Twitter
- *Velocity*: Rate at which data is created
  - Hundreds of millions of Tweets are sent per day. TPS record:
    one-second peak of 143,199 Tweets per second
  - Order of 100B interaction events per day
- *Volume*: 100s of petabytes of data
- *Variety*: Tweets, Users, LIkes, Retweets and many more

Production Systems
  - Batch (Hadoop, HDFS, MapReduce)
  - Real-time (Eventbus, Kafka Streams)

Analytics Tools
  - Batch: Scalding, Spark
  - Real-time: Heron
  - Lambda (Batch + Real-time): Summingbird, TSAR
  - Interactive: Presto, Vertica, R

Analytics Front-ends

*** Hadoop
- Some of the largest Hadoop clusters in the world: > 10k nodes
- Store 100s of peabytes of data
- More than 100k daily jobs
- [[https://github.com/twitter/ambrose][twitter/ambrose]] for visualizing Hadoop jobs

*** Core Data Libraries
- [[https://github.com/twitter/scalding][twitter/scalding]]: DSL on top of Cascading (Java library for MapReduce)
- [[https://github.com/twitter/summingbird][twitter/summingbird]]: Lambda architecture: real-time and batch

*** Interactive SQL
- Interactive means that results of a query are available from the
  range of seconds to couple of minutes
- SQL still lingua franca of ad-hoc data analysis:
  - Presto
  - HP Vertica
  - Google BigQuery

*** Data Visualization:
- Apache Zepplin
- Tableu

*** Data Insights 
- Analytics - Basic Counting
- A/B Testing
- Data Science - Exploratory Analysis
- Data Science - Machine Learning

*** Basic Counting
- Daily/Monthly Acitve Users
- Number of Tweets

*** Data Science - Custom Analytics
- Cause of spikes and dips in main metrics

*** Machine Learning
- Recommendations
  - Users: Who to follow
  - Tweets: Algorithmic timeline
- [[https://cortex.twitter.com/en.html][Cortex]], DL based on Torch framework (now Tensorflow)
  - Identify NSFW images
  - Recognize what is happening in live feeds

*** Ideal Talent Stack
- Systems (Hadoop, Distributed Systems)
- Programming (Scala, Scalding, SQL)
- Math (Statistics, Linear Algebra)
