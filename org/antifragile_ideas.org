#+title: Anti-fragile Ideas

This system was originally discussed by John Carmack [[https://amasad.me/carmack][here]]. We want to
work on ideas that are not brittle, but how do we know they aren't?

1. When we get the idea, we should *instantly try to defeat it*
2. If the idea survives the brutal scrutiny, then it has legs for
   further investigation
3. If the idea is implemented, and it works, great
4. Else, we can quickly move on to the next idea

This allows us to generate more ideas by quickly going through ideas
that may not work. It also has a quick filter to poor ideas.
