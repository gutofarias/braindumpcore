When we analise a system or a [[file:joints.org][joint]], it has an allowed motion, which are the [[file:degrees_of_freedom.org][degrees of freedom]]. The motion that is not allowed is then constrained. For each translation motion constrained there should be a force and for each rotation motion constrained there should be a torque/moment.
