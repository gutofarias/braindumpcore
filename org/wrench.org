In [[file:screw_theory.org][Screw Theory]], a wrench is a [[file:screw.org][Screw]] carrying an action, which is a screw multiplied by a force quantity.

If we describe a wrench as a [[file:dual_vector.org][dual vector]], the result is a force vector in the [[file:real_part.org][real part]] and a moment vector in the [[file:dual_part.org][dual part]] of the wrench.

If we describe a wrench using [[file:plucker_coordinates.org][Plucker Coordinates]], the first three components are the force and last three are the moment.
