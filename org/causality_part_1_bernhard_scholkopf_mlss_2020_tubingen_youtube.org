* Background and Motivation

Consider a dataset of temperature $t$ vs altitude $a$. We typically see that the
larger the altitude, the lower the temperature. How do we know if this is a
causal effect?

1. Intervention: we can raise the city, and find that the temperature changes
2. Hypothetical intervention: expect that $t$ changes, since we can think of a
   physical mechanism $p(t|a)$ that is independent of $p(a)$. We expect that
   $p(t|a)$ is invariant across different countries in similar climate zone.

A "structural" relation not only explains the observed data; it captures a
structure connecting the variables.

An equation becomes structural by virtue of invariance to a domain of
modifications.
