#+title: Likelihood Field Model

- tags :: [[id:011be61f-9934-4996-9c6c-328a19eaff96][Map Matching]]

* Key Idea
Project an individual sensor measurement $z_t^k$ into the global
coordinate frame of map $m$. Discards max-range readings.

Assumes three types of noise, similar to [[id:397e2e11-2f27-474b-95c6-108bfa8e75fc][Range Finder Model]]:

1. Measurement noise: Gaussian
2. Failures: point-mass distribution at $z_{\text{max}}$
3. Random measurements: Uniform distribution $p_{\text{rand}}$

The model is a mixture of these 3 densities:

\begin{equation}
  z_{\mathrm{hit}} \cdot p_{\mathrm{hit}}+z_{\mathrm{rand}} \cdot p_{\mathrm{rand}}+z_{\mathrm{max}} \cdot p_{\mathrm{max}}
\end{equation}

* Issues

1. Does not explicitly model dynamic objects that cause short readings
2. Treats sensors as being able to see through walls: ray casting
   replaced by nearest neighbour function: incapable of determining
   whether a path to a point is intercepted by an obstacle in the map
3. Does not account for map uncertainty

These issues can be addressed via extensions to the algorithm.
