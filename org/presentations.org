* Creating Good Presentations

1. Adjust to the frequency of your audience so that the message
   resonates deeply. The audience will then display self-organizing
   behaviour.

2. Has a clear beginning, middle and end

3. Has identifiable  inherent structure

4. The first plot point is an incident that captures the audience's
   intrigue and interest

5. The audience is the hero in your story. The aim is to get the
   audience to overcome the reluctance to change, and enter the world
   you are presenting.

Familiar content is comforting, oppositional content is stimulating,
combined these produce forward movement.
