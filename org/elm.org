A [[file:functional_programming.org][Functional Programming]] language made to write [[file:web_applications.org][Web Applications]], or I think maybe more like front-end stuff. The language emphasis is on easy of use, no been overly complicated. Has a syntax similar to [[file:haskell.org][Haskell]].

I did some reseach in the topic so to produce something support material for my classes and a reason to practice Haskell. Elm although is not as haskellish as [[file:purescript.org][Purescript]], turns out to be way simpler to work, as far as I could tell.
