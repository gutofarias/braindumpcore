#+title: Portfolio Composition

* General recommendations

1. Invest in ETFs, not single stocks ([[id:b37ead31-5908-4a42-9e77-8343d8d0ae35][Investing In ETFs]])
2. Invest "110 minus your age" into stocks, and the rest into bonds
3. For the stock component, half should be in local-stock ETF and half
   in global stock ETF
   1. Global stock ETF is inherently more volatile, affected by
      currency
4. The bond component should be entirely local
