#+title: Collaborative Editing

Collaborative Editing software are powered either (or both) of these
two techniques: Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) or
Operational Transforms (OT).

I once gave a talk on OT: [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qMi_zQxm6E9fxXi8RFnfhaOvvCHEGzD-NPQjpD_F63w/edit?usp=sharing][Real-time Collaboration - Google Slides]]
