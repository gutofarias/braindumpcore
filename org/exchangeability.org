#+title: Exchangeability

A set of parameters $\theta = (\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}, \dots, \theta_{k})$ is exchangeable if the distribution of $\theta$ is unchanged when the parameter components are permuted. One's prior belief about $\theta_{j}$ will be the same as one's prior beliefs of $\theta_{k}$.
