* Running Form

1. Maintain a cadence of at least 160 steps per minute (aim for 180)
   1. Stride length, cadence proportional to pace, and we do not want
      stride length to compensate for lower cadence, as this leads to
      feet landing in front of body, resulting in a damaging breaking
      effect.
2. Whether it is a heel or fore-foot strike is less important than
   landing in the body's center of mass.
3. Knee should be in line with the middle of foot so that when foot
   strikes the ground, itâ€™s right under the knee
