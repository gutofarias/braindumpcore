* Motivations
- There's a ton of books covering the art of writing, and very little
  on note-taking.
- These books don't cover the connections between note-taking and
  writing well.

#+begin_quote
Notes aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking
process. -- [[id:915ee121-8a13-46dd-9005-73eba3f730a2][Richard Feynman]]
#+end_quote

The mind is extremely reliant of external scaffolding:

#+begin_quote
Notes on paper, or on a computer screen ... do not make contemporary
physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it
possible -- Neil Levy (Neuroethics and the Extended Mind)
#+end_quote

Hence, use the [[id:c178794c-78d1-459d-9725-15f2f6cd970a][Zettelkasten]] method. To get around this idea of
note-taking, it is important to understand that:

1. Note sequences are meant for developing ideas, not storing them
2. Links and indices are helpful, but not central features
3. The workflow is streamlined to writing

In [[id:c178794c-78d1-459d-9725-15f2f6cd970a][Zettelkasten]], the most time-consuming portion is determining /the
order/ for the notes in which to write about.

* Concrete Changes

1. Instead of highlighting passages, manually create notes of the
   ideas you get as you read. These notes should be relevant to the
   contexts important to you, not just related to the book you read.

2. Always reference the source. Cite, or indicate the page number.
3. When copying notes over, try to make the ideas standalone.
4. When filing notes, think instead about: /in which context will I
   want to stumble on it again?/ Use tags for this.
