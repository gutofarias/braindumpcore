#+title: Spike Train Mutual Information

Would be nice to compute the mutual information between multi-neuronal spike
trains in [[id:54691107-81a0-4d7b-8c51-d8a74bde7f86][Spiking Neural Networks]]. Perhaps we can learn some low-level spike
representation, and relate this somehow to [[id:1e986fb8-e87d-45f6-8f6f-446992d493d0][Information Bottleneck in Deep Neural
Networks]].
