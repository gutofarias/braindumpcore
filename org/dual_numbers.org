It is like a complex number but instead of an i (imaginary number) we have an $\epsilon$ having the properties of $\epsilon^2 = 0$ and it commutes freely with real numbers. So a dual number has a real part and a dual part, like $5 + \epsilon \, 6$.

$\epsilon$ can also be thougth as a [[file:dual_operator.org][Dual Operator]].

All sorts of interesting stuff arrives from this simple property, like [[file:dual_angles.org][Dual Angles]].
