#+title: Options Framework

An option is defined as a tuple containing:

1. An initiation function (precondition)
2. An internal policy (behaviour)
3. A termination function (post-condition)

This helps put learning and planning algorithms at the same level of
abstraction. cite:stolle2002learning

* Models vs Actions

- models of actions consist of immediate reward and transition
  probability to next state
- models of options consist of reward until termination, and
  (discounted) transition to termination state

They look a lot like value functions, and can use the TD error to train the
model ([[id:6bcdf2f0-6f2b-47bf-95c1-180a1d81f497][Temporal Difference Learning]]).
