#+title: Markovian Assumption

*Key idea*: the past and future data are independent, conditioned on the
 present.

The Markovian assumption can be violated in many ways:

1. Unmodelled dynamics in the environment
2. Inaccuracies in probabilistic models
3. Approximation errors when using approximate representations of
   belief functions
