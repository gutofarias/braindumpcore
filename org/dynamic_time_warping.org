#+title: Dynamic Time Warping

Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a dynamic programming approach used to
align multi-view time series. The similarity between two sequences are
measured, and used to find an optimal match between them via
time-warping (inserting frames).

This approach requires timesteps in the two sequences to be
comparable, and requires a similarity measure between sequences.
Because DTW requires a pre-defined similarity measure, it has been
extended to [[id:ad0f8f03-f332-4484-9ef0-76e157b41eac][Canonical Correlation Analysis]] which does this computation
in a coordinated space for [[id:c436cacf-5630-4dc6-99ff-e99d9484f85a][Multi-modal Machine Learning]]. This allows
for both aligning and mapping between different modalities jointly in
ean unsupervised manner.
