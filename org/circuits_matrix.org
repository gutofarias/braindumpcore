Each column relates to an [[file:graph_edge.org][edge]] of the [[file:motion_graph.org][Motion Graph]], so there are as many columns as edges. 
For each [[file:networks_graph.org][Networks Graph]] there should be a row in the matrix. The contents of each row is derived by applying [[file:kirchhoff_voltage_law_davies_method.org][Kirchhoff Voltage Law]].
