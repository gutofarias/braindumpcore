In [[file:dual_numbers.org][Dual Numbers]] the $\epsilon$ can be thougth of as an operator that takes a quantity from the [[file:real_part.org][Real Part]] and puts it on the [[file:dual_part.org][Dual Part]]. Of course when the operator acts on a quantity in the dual part, it turns it to zero because $\epsilon^2 = 0$.
