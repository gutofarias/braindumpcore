#+title: Jeffreys Prior

The Jeffrey's prior is an easy-to-compute reference prior that is
invariant to transformation, used in [[id:06635cd6-7ae1-4ba0-b82f-5a344871d94e][Bayesian Inference]]. If the model
only has a univariate parameter $\theta$, the prior is given by:

\begin{equation}
  p(\theta) \propto \sqrt{I(\theta)}
\end{equation}

where $I(\theta)$ is the expected [[id:560a3065-f4f9-4731-bc78-71a1a35ebf73][Fisher information]] in the model.

If $\mathbf{\theta}$ is multi-dimensional, then the Jeffrey's prior is
given by:

\begin{equation}
  p(\theta) \propto \sqrt{\operatorname{det}\{l(\theta)\}}
\end{equation}

where I is the [[id:560a3065-f4f9-4731-bc78-71a1a35ebf73][Fisher information matrix]]. When the number of
dimensions is large, this method becomes cumbersome. A common approach
is to obtain non-informative priors for the parameters individually,
and form the joint prior as a product of these individual priors.
