#+title: Cross-modal Hashing

Cross-modal hashing is the compression of high dimensional data into
compact binary codes with similar binary codes for similar objects.
The key ideas is to create codes for cross-modal retrieval. The
constraints are :

1. It has to be an N-dimensional hamming space -- a binary
   representation with a controllable number of bits.
2. The same object from different modalities has to have a similar
   hash code
3. The space has to be similarity-preserving
