It is a [[file:quaternion.org][Quaternion]] in which its components are [[file:hyper_dual_numbers.org][Hyper-Dual Numbers]]

Can be used to compute the pose and its derivative from at the same quaternion structure, using the [[file:automatic_differentiation.org][Automatic Differentiation]] property.
