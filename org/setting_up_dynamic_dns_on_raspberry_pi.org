#+title: Setting up Dynamic DNS on Raspberry Pi

We want to expose the device to the external web, but our external IP address is
always changing (depending on your ISP).

The solution is dynamic DNS: where we have a domain name resolve to the
ever-changing IP address. We may use a service like [[https://freedns.afraid.org/][FreeDNS]].

First, setup an account at the linked website, and register a subdomain. Next,
we can simply install a [[https://freedns.afraid.org/scripts/freedns.clients.php][FreeDNS client]] on the device:

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install ddclient
#+end_src

This will walk you through the steps for setting ~ddclient~. The following
example config is provided by the website:

#+begin_src text
daemon=5m
timeout=10
syslog=no # log update msgs to syslog
#mail=root # mail all msgs to root
#mail-failure=root # mail failed update msgs to root
pid=/var/run/ddclient.pid # record PID in file.
ssl=yes # use ssl-support. Works with
# ssl-library

use=if, if=eth0
server=freedns.afraid.org
protocol=freedns                # or dyndns1 if facing difficulty
login=login_name
password=the_password
somedomain.mooo.com
#+end_src
