* The original Zettelkasten Method

In the morning, Luhmann would take notes from his readings, penning
them down onto a piece of paper with a source inside.

In the evening, he would go through these notes and expand on them,
writing about how they impact his current studies.

* Indexes in Zettelkasten

Indexes have very few terms. They don't serve as a broad overview of a
topic, but more of an entry point.

* Zettelkasten Note Types

- fleeting :: notes taken as a reminder of what's in your head. These
  are to be removed after some time
  - In [[id:71b27c1b-b851-4128-a5d5-1fed8dd900bb][Roam Research]] and Org-roam, make fleeting notes in daily notes
- project-related :: notes related to a project
- permanent :: notes that are standalone, and make sense in their own context.

* Arguments Against Zettelkasten

- Densely interconnecting ideas across domains results in complex
   mental models, may obscure reality (Source: [[https://fs.blog/venkatesh-rao/][Venkatesh Rao, 2016
   podcast with Farnam Street]])


* Why Zettelkasten

1. Forces you to adopt a linking system: connect ideas, tangents
2. Break ideas up into smaller pieces, increase surface area for
   expansion
