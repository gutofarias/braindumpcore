Take a line cut in the [[file:action_graph.org][Action Graph]] (straight or curved) that cuts only one [[file:branches_in_a_tree_graph.org][branch]] but separates the graph in two parts. [[file:strings_in_a_tree_graph.org][Strings]] can be cutted freely. 

Positiviness of the cutted parts can be found [[file:positiveness_of_a_tree_graph_cut.org][here]].
