The coupling graph is a [[file:graph.org][graph]] created by arranging every [[file:joints.org][joint]] in a [[file:graph_node.org][node]] and every [[file:links_mechanism.org][link]] in an [[file:graph_edge.org][edge]]. 

It is a [[file:directed_graph.org][directional graph]]. The direction can be choose using an arbitrary rule (like pointing to the higher number edge). The direction will determine the positivity of the equations latter on.
