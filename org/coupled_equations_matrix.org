Matrix in which each column uses the [[file:vector_of_system_parameters.org][Vector of System Parameters]] as reference and each row is given by one coupled equation between Kinematics and Statics.
Usually this equation is in the form of a viscous friction.
The equations should be in the form $something = 0$.
