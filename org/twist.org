In [[file:screw_theory.org][Screw Theory]], a twist is a [[file:screw.org][Screw]] carrying motion, which is a screw multiplied by an angular velocity quantity.

If we describe a twist as a [[file:dual_vector.org][dual vector]], the result is a angular velocity vector in the [[file:real_part.org][real part]] and a linear velocity vector in the [[file:dual_part.org][dual part]] of the twist.

If we describe a twist using [[file:plucker_coordinates.org][Plucker Coordinates]], the first three are the angular velocity and last three are the linear velocity.
