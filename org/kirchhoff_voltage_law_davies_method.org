We start with a [[file:graph.org][Graph]] containing a loop defined by a [[file:strings_in_a_tree_graph.org][string]]. Follow the string in the direction of its arrow and go around the loop. You should account with a +1 each [[file:directed_edge.org][edge]] which the arrow is aligned with the direction you are following. And with -1 each arrow that goes against the direction you are following.
