#+title: Interval Estimation in Bayesian Statistics

Suppose instead of [[id:73aa2bb1-a052-46ce-8e94-0601fcd032f9][point estimation]], we'd like to identify a
region that is likely to contain the true value of parameter $\theta$.
In [[id:06635cd6-7ae1-4ba0-b82f-5a344871d94e][Bayesian Inference]], this region is called the /credible set/, or
the /Bayesian confidence interval/.

A $100(1-\alpha)%$ credible set for $\theta$ is subset $\mathcal{C}$
of $\Theta$ such that:

\begin{equation}
  P(\theta \in \mathcal{C} | y)=\int_{\mathcal{C}} p(\theta | y) \mathrm{d} \theta \geq 1-\alpha
\end{equation}

Interpreting credible sets is different in Bayesian statistics,
compared to frequentist confidence intervals.

In [[id:7f0fcd68-3fc2-4936-929c-51ef11ffe862][Bayesian statistics]], the unknown parameters $\theta$ is regarded as
a random variable, and the interval is fixed once data is observed.
That is, we can make direct probabilistic statements like:

#+begin_quote
The probability that $\theta$ lies in $\mathcal{C}$ given observed
data $y$ is $(1-\alpha)$.
#+end_quote

In frequentist statistics, $Y$ is regarded as random, giving rise to a
random interval which has probability $(1-\alpha)$ of containing the
fixed but unknown $\theta$. The corresponding statement is:

#+begin_quote
If we could recompute $\mathcal{C}$ for a large number of datasets
collected the same way, then about $100(1-\alpha)%$ of them will
contain the true value of $\theta$
#+end_quote

Another way to view this is that frequentist and Bayesian notions of
coverage describe pre- and post-experimental coverage respectively.
Researchers have shown that Bayesian credible sets constructed via
some methods will also have almost the correct frequentist coverage.

* Quantile/equal-tails intervals

We find two numbers $\theta_{\alpha / 2}<\theta_{1-\alpha / 2}$, such
that:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{P}\left(\theta<\theta_{\alpha / 2} | y\right)=\alpha / 2 \quad \text { and } \quad \mathrm{P}\left(\theta>\theta_{1-\alpha / 2} | y\right)=\alpha / 2
\end{equation}

The $100(1-\alpha)%$ quantile-based CI is $\left[\theta_{\alpha / 2},
\theta_{1-\alpha / 2}\right]$.

* Highest Posterior Density (HPD) region

The HPD credible set is defined as the set:

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{C}=\{\theta \in \Theta: p(\theta | y) \geq k(\alpha)\}
\end{equation}

where $k(\alpha)$ is the largest constant satisfying:

\begin{equation}
  P(\theta \in \mathcal{C} | y) \geq 1-\alpha
\end{equation}

All points in a HPD region have higher posterior density than points
outside the region.

To visualize this, imagine drawing a horizontal line across the graph
at the mode of the posterior distribution, and the pushing it down
until the corresponding values on the $\theta$ axis contains the
appropriate probability.

Computing HPD requires numerical methods. HPD might not be an interval
if the distribution is multimodal. Some packages like ~coda~ assumes
that the distribution is not severely multimodal.

Generally, the quantile-based CI will be equal to the HPD region if
the posterior is symmetric and uni-modal, but wider otherwise. For
unimodal posterior densities, the HPD interval has the shortest length
for the same level of coverage.
