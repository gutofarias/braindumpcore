This is a paper review of the NIPS 2018 best paper award-winning paper
[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366][Neural Ordinary Differential Equations]].

* Motivation

In this section, I motivate the benefits of Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs). Many physical phenomena can be modeled
naturally with the language of differential equations. These include
populations of predator and prey, or in physics with regards to motion
between bodies. Differential equations shine where it is easier to
model changes in the systems over time rather than the value
themselves.

Consider a simple pendulum, with the dampening effect of air
resistance. One can model the dynamic system using a second-order ODE,
as such:

\begin{equation}
  \ddot{\theta}(t) = - \mu \dot{\theta}(t) - \frac{g}{L}\sin\left( \theta(t) \right)
\end{equation}

There are infinitely many solutions to this ODE, but generally only
one that satisfies the initial conditions at $t = 0$. We'd like to
find $\theta(t)$ for some any $t$. It turns out finding the solutions
to these problems are hard, and numerical methods are required to find
the solutions. These numerical methods range from simplest Euler's
method, to Runge-Kutta methods.

Suppose now that we have some dynamic system (for example, the
pendulum), and we have measured some data from the system
$\hat{\theta}(t)$ (the pendulum's position, at time $t$). *Can a neural
network learn the dynamics of the system from data?* 

Regular neural networks states are transformed by a series of discrete
transformations:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_{t+1} = f(\mathbf{h}_t)
\end{equation}

where $f$ could be of different kinds of layers, including convolutional
and dense layers. $t$ can be interpreted as a time index, transforming
some input data at $t=0$ to an output in a different space at $t=N$,
where there are $N$ layers.

Because neural networks apply discrete transformations, to learn
dynamical systems with (recurrent) neural networks, one must
discretize the time steps, for example through binning the
observations into fixed time intervals. However, expressing time as a discrete
variable can be unnatural: this includes processes where events
occur at irregular intervals. This means that the current
state-of-the-art neural networks are still unable to model continuous
sequential data.

* The Analogy to Residual Neural Networks 

In neural networks, every layer introduces error that compounds through the neural
network, hindering overall performance. The only way to bypass this is
to add more layers, and limit the complexity of each step. This means
that the highest performing neural networks would have infinite
layers, and infinitesimal step-changes, an infeasible task.

To address this problem, deep residual neural networks were presented
cite:he15_deep_resid_learn_image_recog. 

Instead of learning $h_{t+1} = f(h_t, \theta_t)$, deep residual neural
networks now learn the difference between the layers: $h_{t+1} = h_t +
f(h_t, \theta_t)$. For example, feed-forward residual neural networks
have a composition that looks like these:

\begin{align*}
  h_1 &= h_0 + f(h_0, \theta_0) \\
  h_2 &= h_1 + f(h_1, \theta_1) \\
  h_3 &= h_2 + f(h_2, \theta_2) \\
  \dots \\
  h_{t+1} &= h_t + f(h_t, \theta_t) \\
\end{align*}

These iterative updates correspond to the infinitesimal step-changes
described earlier, and can be seen to be analogous to an Euler
discretization of a continuous transformation
cite:lu17_beyon_finit_layer_neural_networ. In the limit, one can
instead represent the continuous dynamics between the hidden units
using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) specified by some neural
network:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = f(\mathbf{h}(t), t, \theta)
\end{equation}

where the neural network has parameters $\theta$. The equivalent of
having $T$ layers in the network, is finding the solution to this ODE at
time $T$.

The analogy between ODEs and neural networks is not new, and has been
discussed in previous papers
cite:lu17_beyon_finit_layer_neural_networ,haber17_stabl_archit_deep_neural_networ.
This paper popularized this idea, by proposing a new method for
scalable backpropagation through ODE solvers, allowing end-to-end
training within larger models.

* The NeuralODE Model

The Neural ODE model introduces a new type of block the authors term the
ODE block. This block replaces the ResNet-like skip connections, with
an ODE that models the neural network's dynamics:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = f(\mathbf{h}(t), t, \theta)
\end{equation}

This ODE can then be solved using a black box solver, with the output
state being used to compute the loss:

\begin{equation}
  L(\mathbf{z}(t_1)) = L\left( \mathbf{z}(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t_1}
    f(\mathbf{z}(t), t, \theta)dt \right) =
  L(\textrm{ODESolve}(\mathbf{z}(t_0), f, t_0, t_1, \theta))
\end{equation}

The loss is used to compute gradients, but, as mentioned in the paper,
performing backpropagation through the ODE solver incurs too high a
memory cost. Here, I illustrate why, with a simple example.

Suppose we use the Euler method to solve the ODE. The Euler solver update
step is similar to a ResNet block:

\begin{equation}
  h_{t+1} =  h_t + NN(h_{t})
\end{equation}

Continuous-depth networks will have large $t$. Despite the ODE solvers
being easily differentiable, backpropagating through the neural
network in this case is equivalent to computing and storing the
gradients in a $t$-depth ResNet. With higher-order ODE
solvers, the memory requirements are also higher.

The paper proposes a method of computing gradients by solving a
second, augmented ODE backwards in time, that is applicable to all ODE
solvers.

* Gradient Computation via Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis

If one wishes to train a Neural ODE via gradient descent, one would
need to compute gradients for the loss function
$L(\textrm{ODESolve}(\mathbf{z}(t_0), f, t_0, t_1, \theta))$. This
requires propagation of gradients through the ODE-solver, that is,
gradients with respect to $\theta$. The paper proposes a technique
that scales linearly with problem size, has low memory cost, and
explicitly controls numerical error.

Sensitivity analysis defines a new ODE whose solution gives the
gradients to the cost function w.r.t. the parameters, and solves this
secondary ODE. Because the gradients of the loss is dependent on the
hidden state $z(t)$ at each instant, the dynamics of $z(t)$ can be
represented with yet another ODE. Obtaining the gradients would
require a single solve by recomputing $z(t)$ backwards together with
the adjoint. The derivations are provided in the appendix of the
paper, and will not be repeated here.
cite:chen18_neural_ordin_differ_equat

Since a large part of the paper's contribution is the ability to
bridge many years of mathematical advancements on solving differential
equations, it is wise to analyse the pros and cons of other solvers in
the context of training machine learning models.

Traditional adjoint sensitivity analysis require multiple forward
solutions of the ODE, which can become prohibitively costly in large
models. The paper's proposal reduces the computational complexity to a
single solve, while retaining low memory cost by solving the backwards
solution together with the adjoint. One issue that the paper has
failed to address is that their proposed method requires that the ODE
integrator is time-reversible.  There are no ODE solvers for
first-order ODEs that are time-reversible, implying that the method
proposed will diverge on some systems cite:rackauckas19_diffeq.

In general, while the model is agnostic of the choice of ODE solver,
the ideal choice of differential equation solver depends on the
problem to be solved. For different classes of differential equations
(under certain assumptions), some solvers will prove to be more
efficient or more accurate. A good rule of thumb is that forward-mode
automatic differentiation is efficient for differential equations with
a small number of parameters, while reverse-mode automatic
differentiation is more efficient when the model size grows bigger.

* Replacing ResNets
Because an ODE block is simply the continuous version of the Residual
block, it seems plausible to use ODE blocks as replacements for ResNet
blocks. The authors of the paper experimented with MNIST, and found
that using ODE blocks they were able to achieve roughly equivalent
test-error, with a third of the parameters (0.22M compared to 0.60M)
and constant memory cost during training.

While this looks promising, it would be more instructive to train the
ODEnet on different datasets.

It turns out that because of the continuous limit, there is a class of
functions that Neural ODEs. In particular, Neural ODEs can only learn
features that are homeomorphic to the input space.
cite:dupont19_augmen_neural_odes The errors arising from
discretization allow ResNet trajectories to cross, allowing them to
represent certain flows that Neural ODEs cannot.

* Experiments

To understand Neural ODEs, I referenced several implementations.
First, I ran the [[https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq][implementation provided with the paper]]. With the
provided code, it was easy to reproduce the results of the Neural ODE
model for MNIST. 

To further understand the how to write solvers for ODEs and the
Adjoint method, I referenced the [[https://github.com/kmkolasinski/deep-learning-notes/tree/master/seminars/2019-03-Neural-Ordinary-Differential-Equations][implementations from a seminar]]. The
example notebooks provided were small and self-contained, I wrote the
naive ODE solver using Euler's method, and swapped out the adjoint ODE
solver. Even for a relatively dataset of relatively small
dimensionality, using it to train on the MNIST dataset took an hour.
Each epoch took slightly longer than the previous, which the authors
attribute to the increasing number of function evaluations, as a
result of the model adapting to increasing complexity. Perhaps one
could place a penalty on model complexity (something like MDL), to
prevent overfitting, and maintain interpretability of the learnt model.

In general, I found that the gains from having to train a model with
fewer parameters is offset by the difficulty in training. In my
experiments conducted, the full data-set is passed for evaluation and
gradient descent is used to update the parameters. The authors have
mentioned that mini-batching, and using stochastic gradient descent is
tricky. Doing a full gradient descent may be infeasible where the
dataset is too large, and the sub-gradients cannot fit into memory.

* ODE as Prior Knowledge

A use-case that I have not seen discussed with the introduction of
Neural ODEs is the ability to introduce structure to the machine
learning models. 

Suppose we have collected data from some known dynamic system, and
wish to learn the system. Traditional machine learning models have no
way of specifying the structure of the dynamic system, and the model
would have to learn its model parameters solely from the data.
However, supposing we know the equations governing the dynamic system:
for example, it is a system for which the laws of physics govern the
system (gravitational attraction between objects). We can then
restrict the hypothesis class to the family of functions that satisfy
the equations, while ensuring that learning is still realizable (there
exists the correct hypothesis $h^*$ in the subclass $\mathcal{H'}$).
Restricting the hypothesis space would lead to lower sample
complexity.

* Closing Thoughts

This paper presented a new family of models called Neural ODEs. They
naturally arise by taking the continuous limit in residual neural
networks. The paper proposes a numerically unstable, but empirically
working method for performing back-propagation through black-box ODE
solvers, making training neural ODEs feasible. 

While not novel, this paper brought into the limelight the idea of
marrying differential equations with machine-learning, an area that
has seemingly a lot of potential.

From experimentation, I find that Neural ODEs are still difficult to
train beyond simple problems, and mathematical theory shows that the
choice of the ODE solver is still important. 

In this review, I did not cover the applications of Neural ODEs in
other areas. First, they have a particularly convenient formulation
for Continuous Normalizing Flows. Normalizing flows is a technique for
sampling from complex distributions via sampling from a simple
distribution, and has applications in techniques like variational
inference.
