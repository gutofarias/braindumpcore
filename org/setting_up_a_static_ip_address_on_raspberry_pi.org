#+title: Setting up a Static IP Address on Raspberry Pi

This really just involves editing ~/etc/dhcpcd.conf~. The configuration here looks like:

#+begin_src text
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.10
static routers=192.168.1.1      # Set this to the router's gateway address
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8 # List of DNS servers, may use router as the only and default
#+end_src
