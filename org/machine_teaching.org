* Problem Formulation
Machine learning takes a given training dataset $D$ and learns a model
$\hat{\theta}$. The learner can take various formrs, including version
space learners, Bayesian learners, deep neural networks, or cognitive
models.

In contrast, in machine teaching the target model $\theta^*$ is given,
and the teacher finds a teaching set $D$ -- not necessarily i.i.d. -
such that a machine learner trained on $D$ will approximately learn
$\theta^*$.

In machine teaching, we wish to solve the following optimization
problem:

\begin{align}
  \begin{matrix}
    \textrm{min}_{D, \hat{\theta}} & \textrm{TeachingRisk}(\hat{\theta}) +
                             \eta \textrm{TeachingCost}(D) \\
                             \textrm{s.t.} & \hat{\theta} = \textrm{MachineLearning}(D).
  \end{matrix}
\end{align}

Where $\textrm{TeachingRisk(\hat{\theta})}$ is a generic function for
how unsatisfied the teacher is. The target model $\theta^*$ is folded
into the teaching risk function. The teaching cost function is also
generalized beyond the number of teaching items. For example,
different teaching items may have different cognitive burdens for a
human student to absorb. cite:zhu18_overv_machin_teach

There are other formulations of machine teaching that place different
constraints on the teaching. For example, one may want to minimize the
teaching cost, while constraining the teaching risk, or instead choose
to optimize the teaching risk given constraints on the teaching cost.

** Why bother if $\theta^*$ is known?

There are applications where the teacher needs to convey the target
model $\theta^*$ to a learner via training data. For example:

- In education problems, the teacher may know $\theta^*$ but is unable
  to telepathize the model to the students. If the teacher possesses a
  good cognitive model on how students learn from samples, they can
  use machine teaching to optimize the choice of learning examples.
- In training-set poisoning, an attacker manipulates the behaviour of
  a machine learning system by maliciously modifying the training
  data. An attacker knowing the algorithm may send specially designed
  training examples to manipulate the learning algorithm.




* Faster Teaching Via POMDP Teaching cite:Rafferty_2015

The authors formulate teaching as a POMDP, and use a
decision-theoretic approach to planning teaching. Assuming knowledge
about the student's learning model, the teacher is able to find
optimal teaching actions.

A POMDP is specified as a tuple:

\begin{equation}
\langle S, A, Z, p(s'|s, a), p(z|s,a), r(s,a), \gamma \rangle
\end{equation}

- S :: set of states
- A :: set of actions
- Z :: set of observations
- $p(s' | s, a)$ :: transition model
- $p(z|s, a)$ ::  Probability of observing z
- $r(s,a)$ :: Reward/cost model
- $\gamma$ :: Discount factor

POMDP planning seeks to choose actions that minimize
$\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r(s_t, a_t)$.

The learner model specifies the space $S$ of possible knowledge
states, and transition model $p(s'|s ,a)$ for how knowledge changes.

Simple learner models for concept learning can be specified. For
example, in the memoryless model, if an action is consistent with the
current concept, then the state stays the same. Else, the learner
transitions to a state that is consistent with the action, with
probability proportional to the prior probability of the concept:

\begin{equation}
  p(s_{t+1} = c_i | s_t = c_j , a_t) = \begin{cases}
    p_0(c_i) & \textrm{ if $c_i$ is consistent with $a_t$} \\
    0 & \textrm{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Experiments showed that POMDP planning leads to faster teaching.

** Limitations
1. POMDP relies on having models of learning. The models that we
   currently have do not fully model human learning. Human learners
   can also learn better if they are aware they are being taught. The
   models are not accurate enough to know when to decide to terminate
   teaching. *Are we able to learn to teach without explicitly
   assuming a student model?*

2. Beyond time to teach, it is difficult to incorporate other factors
   such as motivation. The learners may have their own reward
   function, and a joint optimization of the student and teacher
   rewards is computationally more difficult.

3. POMDP can be computationally intractable, requiring the use of
   techniques such as MCTS and forward search, sampling only possible
   actions taken.

   1. Suppose a task is modelled with a discrete state space. A task
      with 1000 states will result in a belief state of 1000
      dimensions. To overcome this "curse of dimensionality",
      point-based POMDP algorithms like HSVI2 and SARSOP use
      probabilistic sampling.

   2. One can also factor out the fully observable state components to
      reduce the dimensionality of the belief space into $S = X \times
      Y$, where $X$ is the space of all possible values fully
      observable variables, and $Y$ is the space of partially
      observable variables.  cite:Du2010APA Since state variable $x$
      is fully observable, we only need to maintain belief $b_Y$ for
      the state variables in $Y$.

* Machine Teaching For Inverse Reinforcement Learning cite:brown18_machin_teach_inver_reinf_learn

Optimal Teaching for IRL gives:

1. Insights into the intrinsic difficulty of teaching certain
   sequential decision-making tasks
2. Provides a lower bound on the number of samples needed by the
   active IRL algorithm
3. Optimal teaching can be used to design algorithms that better
   leverage highly informative demonstrations which do not follow the
   i.i.d assumptions made by many IRL applications

** Machine Teaching Problem for IRL
Given an MDP, $M$, and the teacher's reward function, $R^* =
\mathbf{w}^{*^T} \phi (s)$, find the set of demonstrations, $D$, that
minimizes the following optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
  \textrm{min}_{D} \textrm{TeachingCost}(D) \textrm{ s.t. }
  \textrm{Loss}(\mathbf{w^*}, \hat{\mathbf{w}}) \le \epsilon,
  \hat{\mathbf{w}} = IRL(D)
\end{equation}

Optimizing this is hard, since there are a large number of candidate
sets of demonstrations, and the IRL problem needs to be solved for
each candidate set. The paper proposes a greedy set-cover
approximation algorithm that requires solving only a single
policy-evaluation problem, using the Behavioural Equivalence Class
(BEC) of the teacher's policy.

* Teaching Inverse Reinforcement Learners via Features and Demonstrations cite:haug18_teach_inver_reinf_learn_via_featur_demon

It is difficult to specify a reward function that captures all
important aspects. In these situations, learning from demonstrations
transforms the need of specifying this reward function to the task of
providing examples of optimal behaviour.

The paper considers the following setting:

- The true reward function is a linear combination of features known
  to the teacher
- The learner also assumes the reward function is a linear combination
  of features, different from the important ones (e.g. observing only
  a subset)
- The /teaching risk/ is proposed to bound the performance gap of the
  teacher and learner as a function of the learner's worldview

Teaching risk is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \rho\left(A^{L} ; \mathbf{w}^{*}\right) :=\max _{v \in
    \operatorname{ker} A^{L},\|v\| \leq 1}\left\langle\mathbf{w}^{*},
    v\right\rangle
\end{equation}

Where $A^L$ is the learner's worldview. Geometrically it is the cosine
of the angle between ker $A^L$ and $\mathbf{w}^*$.

Limiting the set of teachable features, choosing features that allow
for minimizing teaching risk experimentally shows better performance
than randomly choosing features.

* Learner-aware Teaching: Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Preferences and Constraints cite:tschiatschek19_learn_aware_teach

This paper considers the setting where the learner has preferences.
This captures:

1. behavioural bias
2. mismatched worldviews
3. physical constraints

Learner-aware teaching shows significant performance improvements

/Math of the paper is beyond me right now./

* Interactive Teaching Algorithms for Inverse Reinforcement Learning cite:kamalaruban19_inter_teach_algor_inver_reinf_learn

Considers the setting where the learner is assisted by a teacher. Two
sub-settings are considered:

1. Where the teacher can fully observe the student's current policy,
   and understands the student's dynamics (for theoretical bounds)
2. Where the teacher only has a noisy estimate of the learner's
   current policy, and does not understand the student's dynamics

The environment is modelled as a MDP, where the learner does not have
access to the reward furncion R. The teaching objective is to achieve
a high-performing policy through learning from teacher demonstrations.

The learner is asssumed to use the MCE-IRL algorithm. Theoretical
analysis of the omniscient teacher shows that only $O(\log
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ demonstrations are required to achieve the
teaching objective, an exponential improvement compared to selecting
demonstrations at random.

In the black box setting, the strategy considered picks the most
informative demonstration. This is evaluated experimentally. The black
box teacher is shown to learn faster than the agnostic teacher, in
both the linear and non-linear reward setting. In the non-linear
reward setting, both learners are unable to learn a good policy, but
in the black box teaching setting progress is made much quicker.

/Would be interesting to work through the proofs./

* Bayesian Teaching
Bayesian teaching aims to induce a target model in the learner by
presenting teaching sets of data. This involves two sides of
inference:

1. Teacher's inference: over the space of possible teaching sets
2. Learner's inference: over the space of possible target models

** Bayesian Teaching as Model Explanation
The intuition is that subsets of training data that lead a model to
the same (or approximately similar) inference as the model trained on
all the data should be useful for understanding the fitted model.
cite:ravi_bayesian_teaching_mnist

Below is an example of using Bayesian teaching, limited to a teaching
set of dimension 2, to understand an MNIST model.

#+downloaded: /tmp/screenshot.png @ 2019-05-19 16:30:05
[[file:images/machine_teaching/screenshot_2019-05-19_16-30-05.png]]

One can inspect the best and worst teaching sets to understand what
the model finds to be the best and worst representations for a
particular number.

Hence, Bayesian teaching is also useful in telling us which examples
are most valuable: better suited to induce the desired target model.

* Learning To Interactively Learn and Assist cite:woodward19_learn_to_inter_learn_assis

Rewards and demonstrations are often defined and collected before
training begins, when the human is most uncertain about what
information would help the agent.

Key idea: use /interactive learning/ in contrast to rewards or
demonstrative learning to enable an agent to learn from another agent
who knows the current task.

Interactive learning 

* Robot Teaching and the Sim2Real gap

Obtaining real-world training data can be expensive, and many RL
algorithms are sample-inefficient. Hence, many models are trained in a
simulated environment, and the "sim2real" gap causes these models to
perform poorly on real-world tasks.
cite:lilian_domain_random_sim2r_trans

There are several approaches to closing the sim2real gap:

1. System Identification
   - /System identification/ involves building a mathematical model for
     a physical system. This requires careful calibration, which can
     be expensive.
2. Domain Adaptation
   - This refers to a set of transfer learning techniques that update
     the data distribution in the simulated environment to match that
     of the real world. Many of these are build on adversarial loss or GAN.
3. Domain Randomization
   - A variety of simulated environments with randomized properties
     are created, and to allow for training a robust model that works
     across all these environments.

Both DA and DR are unsupervised. While DA requires a large amount of
real data samples to capture the distribution, DR requires little to no
real data.

** Domain Randomization

*** Definitions

- source domain :: The environment we have full access to (the
                   simulator). This is where training happens.
- target domain :: The environment we want to transfer our model to
                   (the real world)
- randomization parameters :: A set of parameters in the source
     domain, which we can sample $\xi$

*** Goal

During policy training, episodes are collected from the source domain
with randomization applied. The policy learns to generalize across
all the environments. The policy parameter $\theta$ is trained to
maximize the expected reward $R(\cdot)$ average across a distribution
of configurations:

\begin{equation}
\theta^{*}=\arg \max _{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\xi \sim \Xi}\left[\mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\theta}, \tau \sim e_{\xi}}[R(\tau)]\right]
\end{equation}

where $\tau_{\xi}$ is a trajectory collected in the source domain
randomized with $\xi$. *Discrepancies between the source and target
domains are modelled as variability in the source domain*.

In /uniform domain randomization/, each randomization parameter
$\xi_{i}$ is bounded by an interval $\xi_{i}
\in\left[\xi_{i}^{\mathrm{low}}, \xi_{i}^{\mathrm{high}}\right], i=1,
\ldots, N$, and each parameter is uniformly sampled within the range.

**** TODO read https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06907, https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04201

*** TODO Domain Randomization as Optimization (read https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11774)

One can view learning of randomization parameters as a bilevel
optimization.

Assume we have access to the real environment $e_{\textrm{real}}$ and
the randomization configuration is sampled from a distribution
parameterized by $\phi$, $\xi \sim P_{\phi}(\xi)$, we would like to
learn a distribution on which policy $\pi_\theta$ is trained on can
achieve maximal performance in $e_{\textrm{real}}$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}{\phi^{*}=\arg \min _{\phi}
  \mathcal{L}\left(\pi_{\theta^{\prime}(\phi)} ; e_{\text { real
  }}\right)} \\ {\text { where } \theta^{*}(\phi)=\arg \min
  _{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\xi \sim
  P_{\phi}(\xi)}\left[\mathcal{L}\left(\pi_{\theta} ;
  e_{\xi}\right)\right]}\end{array}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}(\pi ; e)$ is the loss function of policy $\pi$
evaluated in the environment $e$.

*** Guided Domain Randomization

Vanilla Domain Randomization assumes to access to the real data, and
randomization configuration is sampled as broadly and uniformly as
possible in sim, hoping that the real environment is covered under
this broad distribution.

*Idea:* guide domain randomization to use configurations that are "more
realistic". This avoids training models in unrealistic environments.

*** TODO read https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501

* Invariant Risk Minimization cite:arjovsky19_invar_risk_minim

Key idea: To learn invariances across environments, find a data
representation such that the optimal classifier on top of that
representation matches for all environments.

Consider a cow/camel classifier. If we train on labeled images where
most pictures of cows are taken on green pastures, and pictures of
camels in desserts, the classifier may learn to classify green
landscapes as cows, and beige landscapes as camels. 

To solve this problem, we need to identify which properties of the
training data are spurious correlations (e.g. background), and which
are actual phenomenon of interest (animal shape). Spurious
correlations are expected not to hold in unseen data.

The goal is to learn correlations invariant across training
environments.
