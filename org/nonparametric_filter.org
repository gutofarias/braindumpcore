#+title: Non-parametric Filters

- tags :: [[id:155935aa-af99-4629-b232-dfa0b48ad239][Bayes Filter]], [[id:ea8fc8e1-c12b-41fc-a1ea-8eb54f670388][Particle Filter]], [[id:9363fa5a-afb0-4322-86f5-8dfa527a8dfc][Histogram Filter]]

Non-parametric filters do not make strong assumptions on the posterior
density, making them well suited for complex, multi-modal beliefs. The
representational power comes at the cost of computational complexity.

Some non-parametric techniques allow adaptivity. For example, particle filters
can adapt the number of particles based on the available compute resources.
