The kinematics using Davies Method is computed for the velocity. But dynamics needs acceleration. In order to obtain that we will use [[file:hyper_dual_numbers.org][hyper-dual quantities]].

For example, when describing a dual veclocity as a dual vector, we have:

$$ \nu = \omega + \epsilon \, v $$

This has the information of the angular velocity and linear velociy. We extend that using the property of [[file:automatic_differentiation.org][Automatic Differentiation]] to:

$$ \check{\nu} = (\omega + \epsilon \, v) + \check{\epsilon} \, (\dot{\omega} + \epsilon \, \dot{v}) = \nu + \check{\epsilon} \, \dot{\nu} $$
