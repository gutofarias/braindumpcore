The [[file:joints.org][joints]] should be considered as joints in succession. The next joint is build on the updated reference frame of the previous joint.  

When testing the equations, the result I obtained was as if the joint variables were considered as measured by the previous [[file:mobile_reference_frame.org][mobile reference frame]], not as being measured against the [[file:inertial_frame.org][inertial frame]].
