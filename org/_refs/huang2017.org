The work proposes a [[file:../formation_control.org][formation control]] using dual quaternions, the formation error is controlled through a [[file:../sliding_modes.org][sliding modes controller]] and one term is added for [[file:../collision_avoidance.org][collision avoidance]] using [[file:../artificial_potential_function.org][Artificial Potential Function]].

The part of artificial potential function is interesting and intuitive.
