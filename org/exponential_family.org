#+title: Exponential Family

- tags :: [[id:3ec39abc-ea53-4087-8523-7ace154c6aa6][Statistics]]

A one-parameter exponential family model is any model whose density
can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  p(y | \theta)=h(y) g(\theta) \exp \{\eta(\theta) t(y)\}
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is the parameter of the family, and $t(y)$ is the
sufficient statistic for $\theta$.

When a model belongs to the one-parameter exponential family, a family
of conjugate prior distributions is given by:

\begin{equation}
  p(\theta) \propto g(\theta)^{\nu} \exp \{\eta(\theta) \tau\}
\end{equation}

where $\nu$ and $\tau$ are parameters of the prior, such that
$p(\theta)$ is a well-defined pdf.

Combining this prior with a sampling model $Y \sim p(y|\theta)$ yields
the posterior:

\begin{align} p(\theta | y) & \propto p(y | \theta) p(\theta) \\ & \propto g(\theta) \exp \{\eta(\theta) t(y)\} \cdot g(\theta)^{\nu} \exp \{\eta(\theta) \tau\} \\ & \propto g(\theta)^{\nu+1} \exp \{\eta(\theta)[\tau+t(y)]\} \end{align}

which belongs to the same family as the prior distribution, with
parameters $\nu + 1$ and $\tau + t(y)$.
