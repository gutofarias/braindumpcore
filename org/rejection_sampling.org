#+title: Rejection Sampling

*Goal*: To sample from unknown distribution $p(x)$.

* Assumptions
- we cannot sample from $p(x)$
- we have a simple proposal density $q(x)$ we can evaluate within a
  multiplicative factor $Z_q$
- We know the value of a constant $c$, such that $cq^\star(x) >
  p^\star(x)$ for all $x$

* Method

1. Sample from proposal density $q^\star(x)$
2. Evaluate $c q^\star(x)$
3. Generate a uniform distribution $[0, c q^\star(x)]$ and sample $u$
   from it
4. Evaluate $p^\star(x)$
5. If $u > p^\star(x)$, reject, else accept, and add $x$ to the set of
   samples

* Difficulties

1. Works well only when $q(x)$ is a good approximation to $p(x)$,
   keeping $c$ small
2. In high-dimensional settings, $c$ will generally be so large that
   acceptances will be rare
