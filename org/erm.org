#+title: Empirical Risk Minimization

In [[id:5a6f15fa-e5d4-474e-8ead-56b22d890512][Machine Learning]], the training set error is often called the
/empirical error/ or /empirical risk/, and this is the error the
classifier incurs over the sample:

\begin{equation}
L_S(h) = \frac{|\{i \in [m] : h(x_i) \ne y_i\}}{m}
\end{equation}

Given a hypothesis class $H$, finding the hypothesis $h \in H$ that
minimizes the empirical risk is a simple learning strategy.
