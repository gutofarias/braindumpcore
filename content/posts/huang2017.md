The work proposes a [formation control]({{< relref "formation_control" >}}) using dual quaternions, the formation error is controlled through a [sliding modes controller]({{< relref "sliding_modes" >}}) and one term is added for [collision avoidance]({{< relref "collision_avoidance" >}}) using [Artificial Potential Function]({{< relref "artificial_potential_function" >}}).

The part of artificial potential function is interesting and intuitive.
