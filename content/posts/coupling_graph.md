The coupling graph is a [graph]({{< relref "graph" >}}) created by arranging every [joint]({{< relref "joints" >}}) in a [node]({{< relref "graph_node" >}}) and every [link]({{< relref "links_mechanism" >}}) in an [edge]({{< relref "graph_edge" >}}).

It is a [directional graph]({{< relref "directed_graph" >}}). The direction can be choose using an arbitrary rule (like pointing to the higher number edge). The direction will determine the positivity of the equations latter on.
