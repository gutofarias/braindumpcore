The [joints]({{< relref "joints" >}}) should be considered as joints in succession. The next joint is build on the updated reference frame of the previous joint.

When testing the equations, the result I obtained was as if the joint variables were considered as measured by the previous [mobile reference frame]({{< relref "mobile_reference_frame" >}}), not as being measured against the [inertial frame]({{< relref "inertial_frame" >}}).
