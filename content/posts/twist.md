In [Screw Theory]({{< relref "screw_theory" >}}), a twist is a [Screw]({{< relref "screw" >}}) carrying motion, which is a screw multiplied by an angular velocity quantity.

If we describe a twist as a [dual vector]({{< relref "dual_vector" >}}), the result is a angular velocity vector in the [real part]({{< relref "real_part" >}}) and a linear velocity vector in the [dual part]({{< relref "dual_part" >}}) of the twist.

If we describe a twist using [Plucker Coordinates]({{< relref "plucker_coordinates" >}}), the first three are the angular velocity and last three are the linear velocity.
