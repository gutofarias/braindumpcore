The author presents a [Moving Horizon Estimator]({{< relref "moving_horizon_estimator_mhe" >}}) for [pose estimation]({{< relref "pose_estimation" >}}) using Dual Quaternions. They were able to formulate the [cost function]({{< relref "cost_function" >}}) in terms of the DQ product and so satisfying the unitaryness constraint. Also they discretize the DQ and used a Caley transform presented in an article of Selig.
The resulting estimator was more accurate them DQ-MEKF (DQ Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter) and T-UKF (Twistor-bases Unscented Kalman Filter) which the author attributes to the moving horizon strategy (so not only the last result is used).
