Take a line cut in the [Action Graph]({{< relref "action_graph" >}}) (straight or curved) that cuts only one [branch]({{< relref "branches_in_a_tree_graph" >}}) but separates the graph in two parts. [Strings]({{< relref "strings_in_a_tree_graph" >}}) can be cutted freely.

Positiviness of the cutted parts can be found [here]({{< relref "positiveness_of_a_tree_graph_cut" >}}).
