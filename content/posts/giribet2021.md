The authors present a cluster-space formation control and apply it to leader-follower configuration using dual quaternions and reducing steady-state errors when compared to previous works. Experiments are made to validade the formation control using a ground and an aerial vehicles, and using two aerial vehicles.


## Info {#info}

We present a tracking controller for mobile multirobot systems based on dual quaternion pose representations applied to formations of robots in a leader-follower configuration, by using a cluster-space state approach. The proposed controller improves system performance with respect to previous works by reducing steady-state tracking errors. The performance is evaluated through experimental field tests with a formation of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as well as a formation of two UAVs.
