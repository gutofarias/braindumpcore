[Mechanisms]({{< relref "mechanisms" >}}) that are composed of several [kinematic chains]({{< relref "kinematic_chains" >}}) which have the same [start link]({{< relref "base_link" >}}) and the same [end link]({{< relref "end_link" >}}). They are called parallel because all the kinematic chains connect the same base link to the same end-effector. It also can be viewed as several [Closed Kinematic Chains]({{< relref "closed_kinematic_chain" >}}).
