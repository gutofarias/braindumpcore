Matrix in which each column uses the [Vector of System Parameters]({{< relref "vector_of_system_parameters" >}}) as reference and each row is given by one coupled equation between Kinematics and Statics.
Usually this equation is in the form of a viscous friction.
The equations should be in the form \\(something = 0\\).
