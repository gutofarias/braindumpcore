Each column relates to an [edge]({{< relref "graph_edge" >}}) of the [Motion Graph]({{< relref "motion_graph" >}}), so there are as many columns as edges.
For each [Networks Graph]({{< relref "networks_graph" >}}) there should be a row in the matrix. The contents of each row is derived by applying [Kirchhoff Voltage Law]({{< relref "kirchhoff_voltage_law_davies_method" >}}).
