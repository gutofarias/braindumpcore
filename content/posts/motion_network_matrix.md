Start from the [Circuits Matrix]({{< relref "circuits_matrix" >}}) (B) and replace each element of it with the corresponding [twist]({{< relref "twist" >}}) (read the OBS) times the value of the element in B.

OBS.: Actually it uses not the whole twist, just the [screw]({{< relref "screw" >}}) associated with the twist.
