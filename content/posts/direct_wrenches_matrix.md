Is a matrix created by arranging each respective [wrench]({{< relref "wrench" >}}) (read the OBS) in a column, following the order of columns of the [Cut-Set Matrix]({{< relref "cut_set_matrix" >}}).

OBS.: Actually it uses not the whole wrench, just the [screw]({{< relref "screw" >}}) associated with the wrench.
