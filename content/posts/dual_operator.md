In [Dual Numbers]({{< relref "dual_numbers" >}}) the \\(\epsilon\\) can be thougth of as an operator that takes a quantity from the [Real Part]({{< relref "real_part" >}}) and puts it on the [Dual Part]({{< relref "dual_part" >}}). Of course when the operator acts on a quantity in the dual part, it turns it to zero because \\(\epsilon^2 = 0\\).
