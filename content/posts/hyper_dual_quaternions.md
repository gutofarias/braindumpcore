It is a [Quaternion]({{< relref "quaternion" >}}) in which its components are [Hyper-Dual Numbers]({{< relref "hyper_dual_numbers" >}})

Can be used to compute the pose and its derivative from at the same quaternion structure, using the [Automatic Differentiation]({{< relref "automatic_differentiation" >}}) property.
