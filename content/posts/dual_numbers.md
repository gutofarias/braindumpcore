It is like a complex number but instead of an i (imaginary number) we have an \\(\epsilon\\) having the properties of \\(\epsilon^2 = 0\\) and it commutes freely with real numbers. So a dual number has a real part and a dual part, like \\(5 + \epsilon \\, 6\\).

\\(\epsilon\\) can also be thougth as a [Dual Operator]({{< relref "dual_operator" >}}).

All sorts of interesting stuff arrives from this simple property, like [Dual Angles]({{< relref "dual_angles" >}}).
