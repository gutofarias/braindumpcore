I saw it in an article (<sup id="00f39b5169f2732fdc4ff7583047a966"><a href="#huang2017" title="Huang, Yan, Zhou \&amp; Yang, Dual-Quaternion Based Distributed Coordination Control of Six-{{DOF}} Spacecraft Formation with Collision Avoidance, {Aerospace Science and Technology}, v(), 443--455 (2017).">huang2017</a></sup>) and it was used for [collision avoidance]({{< relref "collision_avoidance" >}}) in a [formation control]({{< relref "formation_control" >}}). The idea was to add a repulsive field over the spacecrafts. This repulsive field would generate a repulsive force when two spacecrafts were getting close. Then the repulsive force would be added to the control law.
