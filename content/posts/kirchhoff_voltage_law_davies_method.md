We start with a [Graph]({{< relref "graph" >}}) containing a loop defined by a [string]({{< relref "strings_in_a_tree_graph" >}}). Follow the string in the direction of its arrow and go around the loop. You should account with a +1 each [edge]({{< relref "directed_edge" >}}) which the arrow is aligned with the direction you are following. And with -1 each arrow that goes against the direction you are following.
