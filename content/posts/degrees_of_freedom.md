Refers to the freedom of motion of a system or [joint]({{< relref "joints" >}}). It is usually described as a subset from the allowed motions of a freebody in space, being it 3 independent translations and 3 independent rotations.
When dealing with a system in the plane we consider only 3 allowed motions, 2 independent translations and 1 rotation.

When talking about a joint, it may allow a relative motion between the two or more conected [links]({{< relref "links_mechanism" >}}). The allowed relative motions are the degrees of freedom of the joint.
