In [Screw Theory]({{< relref "screw_theory" >}}), a wrench is a [Screw]({{< relref "screw" >}}) carrying an action, which is a screw multiplied by a force quantity.

If we describe a wrench as a [dual vector]({{< relref "dual_vector" >}}), the result is a force vector in the [real part]({{< relref "real_part" >}}) and a moment vector in the [dual part]({{< relref "dual_part" >}}) of the wrench.

If we describe a wrench using [Plucker Coordinates]({{< relref "plucker_coordinates" >}}), the first three components are the force and last three are the moment.
