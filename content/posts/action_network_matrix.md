Start from the [Cut-Set Matrix]({{< relref "cut_set_matrix" >}}) (Qa) and replace each element of it with the corresponding [wrench]({{< relref "wrench" >}}) (read the OBS) times the value of the element in Qa.

OBS.: Actually it uses not the whole wrench, just the [screw]({{< relref "screw" >}}) associated with the wrench.
