A [Functional Programming]({{< relref "functional_programming" >}}) language made to write [Web Applications]({{< relref "web_applications" >}}), or I think maybe more like front-end stuff. The language emphasis is on easy of use, no been overly complicated. Has a syntax similar to [Haskell]({{< relref "haskell" >}}).

I did some reseach in the topic so to produce something support material for my classes and a reason to practice Haskell. Elm although is not as haskellish as [Purescript]({{< relref "purescript" >}}), turns out to be way simpler to work, as far as I could tell.
