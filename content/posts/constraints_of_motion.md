When we analise a system or a [joint]({{< relref "joints" >}}), it has an allowed motion, which are the [degrees of freedom]({{< relref "degrees_of_freedom" >}}). The motion that is not allowed is then constrained. For each translation motion constrained there should be a force and for each rotation motion constrained there should be a torque/moment.
